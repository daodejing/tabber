# tabber
*tabber* is a neovim plugin for nicer tab closing

In neovim, when closing a tab, you are taken to the most recently created tab.

With this plugin, when you close a tab, you are taken back to your most recently viewed tab.


## Installation
### Lazy
```lua
{
    "daodejing/tabber.nvim",
    config = true,
}
```

## Usage
Just close a tab and you will be taken to the last tab you were on.

## Background
I first felt the need for this plugin when was using multiple tabs and opened and closed the neogit tab.
I was taken back to the most recently created tab, and experienced a moment of confusion.
