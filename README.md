# tabber
*tabber* is a neovim plugin for tabs
It takes you back to your last tab when you close the current tab.
The default neovim behavior is to take you to the most recently created tab, which confused me.
So I made tabber.

## Installation
### Lazy
```lua
{
    "daodejing/tabber",
    opts = {},
}
```
